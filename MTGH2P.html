          In Magic: The Gathering, you are counted among the elite
          spellcasters of the Multiverse-the Planeswalkers. Your deck of cards
          represents your weapons, containing the spells you know and the
          creatures you can summon to fight for you. Games are played by two
          or more palyers, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards.
          Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0
          life by attacking with creatures and playing spells, you win!

        <h3>WHAT IS A TRADING CARD GAME (TCG)?</h3>
        <p>
          Trading card games (TCGs) like Magic: The Gathering combine
          collectable cards with a strategy game. You build your collection of
          cards by buying products such as Booster Packs or Intro Packs as well
          as by trading your cards with friends.
