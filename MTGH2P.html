          In Magic: The Gathering, you are counted among the elite
          spellcasters of the Multiverse-the Planeswalkers. Your deck of cards
          represents your weapons, containing the spells you know and the
          creatures you can summon to fight for you. Games are played by two
          or more palyers, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards.
          Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0
          life by attacking with creatures and playing spells, you win!

            <h3>WHAT IS A TRADING CARD GAME (TCG)?</h3>
            <p>
              Trading card games (TCGs) like Magic: The Gathering combine
              collectable cards with a strategy game. You build your collection of
              cards by buying products such as Booster Packs or Intro Packs as
              well as by trading your cards with friends.

            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
              The foundation of the infinite planes of the Multiverse is mana, the
              energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued in
              the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can
              call upon its mana. Each color of mana fuels a different kind of
              powerful magic for you to command.

            <h3>DECKBUILDING</h3>
            <p>
              Deckbuilding is as big a part of Magic as the game itself. With
              thousands of cards to choose from, and two players bringing their
              own decks to each game, there is never a game which is exactly like
              any other. Learn more about building your own decks to battle
              against your friends!
