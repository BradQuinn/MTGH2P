            In Magic: The Gathering, you are counted among the elite
            spellcasters of the Multiverse-the Planeswalkers. Your deck of cards
            represents your weapons, containing the spells you know and the
            creatures you can summon to fight for you. Games are played by two
            or more palyers, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards.
            Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0
            life by attacking with creatures and playing spells, you win!

                <h3>WHAT IS A TRADING CARD GAME (TCG)?</h3>
                <p>
                  Trading card games (TCGs) like Magic: The Gathering combine
                  collectable cards with a strategy game. You build your collection of
                  cards by buying products such as Booster Packs or Intro Packs as
                  well as by trading your cards with friends.

                <p>
                  The foundation of the infinite planes of the Multiverse is mana, the
                  energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued in
                  the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can
                  call upon its mana. Each color of mana fuels a different kind of
                  powerful magic for you to command.

                <h3>DECKBUILDING</h3>
                <p>
                  Deckbuilding is as big a part of Magic as the game itself. With
                  thousands of cards to choose from, and two players bringing their
                  own decks to each game, there is never a game which is exactly like
                  any other. Learn more about building your own decks to battle
                  against your friends!
